# Data Science Interview Practice

This repository contains code for practicing data science interview questions, adapted from resources provided by [Deep ML](https://www.deep-ml.com/).

## Overview

The code includes exercises and solutions covering various data science topics such as:

- Machine Learning
- Linear Algebra

## Folder Structure

To enhance structured learning, I have created separate folders for different Machine Learning algorithms, implemented from scratch. Each folder contains:

- A `.py` file with the full implementation of the ML algorithm.
- A `train.py` file that serves as the calling function to run the algorithm.

## References

The ML algorithms have been adapted and referenced from the following sources:
